Welcome to our RPG project, for this project we used TypeScript and POO. The aim
of this project is to create a command-line RPG game. To launch the game, you
have to type the command "deno run index.js".

After this you will have to choose 3 characters to build your team. Each
character is different. They have different stats and a unique special attack.

To win the game you have to passed through 5 room. For the first and the third
rooms you will faced 3 differents ennemies. The second and the fourth room are
special because in these room you will only faced a chest. To pass the room you
have to open the chest but there is a chance that you take some damage or if
your are lucky you will get an item. And the last room... The Boss room, in this
room you will faced the Boss and 2 others ennemies.

If you got through all the rooms you win the game. Good Luck.

This project was created by Lechat No√©, Antier Guillaume, Couthouis Edgar.
